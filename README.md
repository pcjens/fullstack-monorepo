This repo contains my exercise solutions for the Fullstack Open course parts 8
onwards. At least it will eventually, at the time of writing, it's still in
progress.

All "exercise solutions" can be found in the commit history by searching the
commit messages for the exercise number (e.g. 8.20). In some rare cases I have
ended up making fixes to specific exercise solutions in a later commit (e.g.
[55248](https://github.com/pcjens/fullstack-monorepo/commit/552485836a543ba759bb9ba184a65cbfb70b88f7) fixed an issue in
[37d9a](https://github.com/pcjens/fullstack-monorepo/commit/37d9a9119e2f5888c964dc6d6620c948d97eb13a) which means that
[37d9a](https://github.com/pcjens/fullstack-monorepo/commit/37d9a9119e2f5888c964dc6d6620c948d97eb13a) isn't actually the whole solution to
the exercise), but if you're reviewing this for a specific part of the course,
it means I'm committed to my solutions as of the last commit related to that
part. The top-level directories are named based on which course module they are
related to, so e.g. all code for Osa 8 exercises are in the osa-8-* directories.
